# 🤖 AI Task Automation Agent

This is my first AI Agent project built using **Python**.

The agent takes user input, analyzes it using simple rules, and responds with an appropriate action.

## 🔹 Features
- Rule-based decision making
- Interactive user input
- Beginner-friendly Python code
- Easy to expand into smarter agents
- 🧠 Memory support (remembers user name & conversation)
- ⚙️ Task automation (file handling, time, system actions)
- 💾 Persistent memory using JSON (remembers data across sessions)


## 🔹 How it works
1. User gives input
2. Agent analyzes keywords
3. Agent decides what to do
4. Agent responds

## 🔹 Technologies
- Python 🐍

## 🔹 Future Improvements
- Add memory
- Add automation
- Convert to a cybersecurity or AI task agent
